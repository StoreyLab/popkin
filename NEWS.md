* Public release!

# 2017-11-21 - popkin 1.0.1.9000

* Fix a bug in which genotypes input to popkin via a function (rather than a regular matrix or a BEDMatrix object) caused popkin to die.  Now popkin behaves as expected.  New test unit cases were added to test function inputs (previously this case was untested).
