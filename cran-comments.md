## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

  These two words are spelled correctly.

Output from https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_popkin.html :
Version: 1.0.4
Check: re-building of vignette outputs
Result: WARN
    Error in re-building vignettes:
     ...
    Quitting from lines 94-98 (popkin.Rmd)
    Error: processing vignette 'popkin.Rmd' failed with diagnostics:
    there is no package called 'lfa'
    Execution halted
Flavors: r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang, r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-gcc

  I have modified the vignette to rebuild without errors when 'lfa' is not available.
